# The Marvel Cinematic Universe Timeline

The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) stands as a monumental achievement in contemporary storytelling, demonstrating the power of interconnected narratives across multiple media. Its success in weaving together numerous character arcs and storylines into a cohesive and expansive universe has captivated global audiences. Understanding the chronological order of events within the MCU is crucial to appreciating the intricate tapestry of its narrative, especially with the integration of Disney+ shows that further enrich and complicate the timeline. The journey through the MCU's history, from its earliest origins to its current multiversal explorations, reveals a carefully constructed saga with deep connections and recurring themes.

Establishing a precise chronology for the MCU presents certain inherent challenges. While the majority of films and shows are relatively straightforward in their placement, occasional overlaps in timelines, the introduction of time travel, and the emergence of multiverse narratives introduce complexities. Furthermore, the canonicity of certain earlier television series, such as Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Netflix Marvel shows, remains a subject of debate within the fan community. The events of "the Blip," the five-year period following Thanos's snap, as well as subsequent time jumps, significantly impact the timeline of the later phases. This report aims to provide a comprehensive chronological timeline based on the available information from the films and Disney+ series themselves, while acknowledging any significant ambiguities or debated points. The methodology employed involves synthesizing information from various reputable sources to establish a consensus-based order, focusing primarily on the in-universe dating provided or strongly implied within the narratives.
