## Hi 👋 I am Yashraj!

I am a developer turned community professional. For the past 6 years, I have been immersed in the 'people' side of technology, building and growing developer communities and programs.

## Journey So Far

I am a developer turned community professional. I love helping developers to come together to learn, grow, and collaborate 🚀

C# was my love. My community journey began as a volunteer during my university days, I was a part of the Microsoft Student Partner program for 4 years and represented India at a worldwide summit at Microsoft HQ 🏅

Over the years, I built and scaled community programs at Japan-based Progate, driving their user base to 200K in India. As part of OutSystems's Developer Relations team, I focused on expanding community programs to 60K developers in Asia Pacific 🌏

At ANSR, I collaborated with a larger team to build community programs from scratch and scaled to 6000+ active developers in 8 months. Hosted 20 events with over 3000 attendees in 2023. These events included ReactJS Bangalore Meetups, React-n-Roll Bengaluru, Full Stack Developers Meetups, Women in Tech Mixer and more 💡

When I am not working, I love following the world of aviation, can talk about airplanes and all things aviation for hours ✈️

## My Toolbox

- Languages, Frameworks and Libraries: C#, JavaScript, React, SQL and a bit of Python.
