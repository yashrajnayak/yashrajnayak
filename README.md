## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Yashraj, a coder turned community professional. I have been building and scaling developer communities and programmes for over four years now. My credo is "every member of the community has a superpower, it's our responsibility to find that superpower" 

Currently, I am managing India Developer Relations ðŸ¥‘ at Progate, Japan's biggest online platform to learn programming with over 1.5 million learners in 100+ countries.
