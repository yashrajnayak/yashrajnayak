## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a developer turned community professional. For the past 6 years, I have been immersed in the 'people' side of technology, building and growing developer communities and programs.

At OutSystems I focused on expanding developer programs in the Asia-Pacific region, reaching more than 60K developers in two years. Before that, I managed the India community at Progate, an online coding learning platform from Japan. Our team enabled platform's growth to 200K users in India. As a Microsoft Student Partner, I represented India at a worldwide summit at Microsoft HQ in 2016.

My passion is to empower developers to learn, create, and share their superpowers with the world.
