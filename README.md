## Journey So Far

As a developer turned community professional, I am really passionate about helping developers to come together to learn and grow üöÄ

C# was my first love. My community journey began as a volunteer during my university days, I was a part of the Microsoft Student Partner program for 4 years and represented India at a worldwide summit at Microsoft HQ üèÖ

Over the years, I built and scaled community programs at Japan-based Progate, driving their user base to 200K in India. As part of OutSystems's Developer Relations team, I focused on expanding community programs to 60K developers in Asia Pacific üåè

At ANSR, I collaborated with a larger team to build community programs from scratch and scaled to 6000+ active developers in 8 months. Hosted 20 events with over 3000 attendees in 2023. These events included ReactJS Bangalore Meetups, React-n-Roll Bengaluru, Full Stack Developers Meetups, Women in Tech Mixer and more üí°

Now as part of the GitHub Developer Relations team , looking forward to connecting with more developers and building something special at GitHub!

When I am not at work, I love following the world of aviation, can talk about airplanes and all things aviation for hours ‚úàÔ∏è

## My Toolbox

- Languages, Frameworks and Libraries: C#, JavaScript, React, SQL and a bit of Python.
- Technologies: Microsoft Azure. Currently diving deep into JS web dev and exploring Generative AI.
