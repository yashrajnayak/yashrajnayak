My community journey began as a Microsoft Student Partner during university, where I represented India at a worldwide summit at Microsoft HQ. Over the past 8 years, I've built and scaled developer communities that have reached hundreds of thousands of tech enthusiasts.

Currently working as Program Manager at GitHub Developer Relations, where I help spark creativity and excitement around GitHub while finding new ways to connect with developers worldwide.
