## Hi üëã I am Yashraj!

 I am a developer and people person. I have been immersed in the 'people' side of technology for over 7 years now, building and growing developer communities across India and APAC.

## Journey So Far

My community journey began as a passionate volunteer during my university days. I was part of the Microsoft Student Partners program for four years and represented India at a worldwide summit at Microsoft HQ  üåè

Over the years, I built and scaled community programs at Japan-based Progate, reaching 200K learners in India. At OutSystems, I collaborated with a larger team and expanded our community programs to more than 60K low-code developers in India and Southeast Asia. At ANSR, I built community programs from scratch, hosting 20 high-quality technology events with clients such as Delta Air Lines and lululemon, engaging over 6000 active developers in 8 months üí°

Currently, I'm helping the GitHub Developer Relations team. We make it easier for developers to work together, solve challenging problems, and create the world‚Äôs most important technologies.
